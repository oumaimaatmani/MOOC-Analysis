
This notebook handles the data preprocessing pipeline for our project on reducing dropout rates in online learning platforms. The goal of this notebook is to:

1. **Load and merge** multiple raw datasets from the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD)
2. **Clean and transform** the data into a machine-learning-ready format
3. **Perform feature engineering** to create meaningful predictors of student dropout
4. **Export processed data** for use in subsequent modeling and analysis

### Dataset Overview
We're working with the OULAD which contains:
- Student demographic information
- Course registration details
- Assessment records
- Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) interaction logs

The raw data comes in 7 separate CSV files that we'll need to merge:
1. `studentInfo.csv` - Student demographics
2. `studentRegistration.csv` - Enrollment records
3. `courses.csv` - Course details  
4. `assessments.csv` - Assessment information  
5. `studentAssessment.csv` - Student results  
6. `studentVle.csv` - VLE interactions  
7. `vle.csv` - VLE resource information

### Processing Pipeline
Our workflow will follow these key steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Import all raw CSV files
2. **Data Merging**: Combine tables using appropriate keys
3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values
   - Fix data types
   - Remove duplicates
   - Address outliers
4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create temporal engagement features
   - Calculate performance metrics
   - Derive behavioral indicators
5. **Data Export**: Save processed data for modeling

### Key Challenges
We anticipate several data challenges to address:
- Handling inconsistent student records across tables
- Managing temporal aspects of engagement data
- Addressing class imbalance in our target variable
- Creating meaningful aggregate features from clickstream data

Let's begin by importing the necessary packages...
